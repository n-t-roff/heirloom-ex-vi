Welcome to the ex/vi port!
==========================

This implementation is derived from ex/vi 3.7 of 6/7/85 and the BSD
termcap library, originally from the 2.11BSD distribution. All of them
were changed to compile and run on newer POSIX compatible Unix systems.
Support for international character sets was added, including support
for multibyte locales (based on UTF-8 or East Asian encodings), and some
changes were made to get closer to the POSIX.2 guidelines for ex and
vi. Some issues that were clearly bugs and not features have also been
resolved; see the Changes file for details.

How to build
============

First look at the Makefile and change the settings there to match your
build environment. Explanations are provided directly in this file.

You can tune the sizes of some internal buffers by editing config.h.

Then type

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install
	# exit
	$ make mrproper

The following systems have been reported to compile this code:

Linux               Kernel 2.0 and above; libc4, libc5, glibc 2.2 and above,
                    diet libc, uClibc
Sun Solaris         2.5.1 and above
Caldera Open UNIX   8.0.0
SCO UnixWare        7.1.1, 7.0.1, 2.1.2
HP HP-UX            B.11.23, B.11.11, B.11.00, B.10.20
HP Tru64 UNIX       4.0G, 5.1B
IBM AIX             5.1, 4.3
NEC SUPER-UX        10.2
NEC UX/4800         Release11.5 Rev.A
Control Data EP/IX  2.2.1AA
FreeBSD             CURRENT (11.0+)
NetBSD              CURRENT (7.0+)
DragonFlyBSD        1.3.7-DEVELOPMENT
Mac OS X            10.4.3
OpenBSD             CURRENT (5.9+)

Reports about other Unix systems are welcome, whether successful or not
(in the latter case add a detailed description). This port of vi is only
aimed at Unix, though, so I am not interested about results from running
this software on Windows etc.

Prerequisites for ports to other systems are:

- The system must provide an ANSI C-89 compiler and POSIX.1-1990 functions.

- The system must provide an sbrk() call to increase the memory heap size.
  If only a fake sbrk() call is provided that works by pre-allocating
  several MB, vi will probably work too.

- The system library must allow replacement of malloc() and printf() by the
  versions provided by vi. For malloc(), it also must make its own internal
  memory requests using the vi malloc(). Otherwise, vi will likely die with
  a segmentation fault because the storage allocated by sbrk() interferes
  with usual Unix library implementations of malloc().

The last two requirements could probably be eliminated with some effort, but
it would not result in any real improvements for usual the Unix platforms vi
is targeted at, so it has not be done yet.


Terminal capabilities
=====================

vi normally uses the termcap library to gather information about the
capabilities of the terminal it is using. A BSD-derived termcap library
is included with the vi distribution, and is usually the preferred choice.
On some platforms, though, either no /etc/termcap file exists, or the file
lacks up-to-date entries. In these cases, two workarounds are possible.
First, vi can be linked against libcurses, libncurses, or libtermcap, if
these provide access to a proper terminal information database. Second, it
is possible to use the included termcap library with a TERMCAP environment
variable that contains a complete termcap entry. Most terminals in current
use provide a superset of DEC VT102 capabilities, so the following will
normally work:

TERMCAP="vt102|$TERM|dec vt102:"'\
	:do=^J:co#80:li#24:cl=50\E[;H\E[2J:\
	:le=^H:bs:cm=5\E[%i%d;%dH:nd=2\E[C:up=2\E[A:\
	:ce=3\E[K:cd=50\E[J:so=2\E[7m:se=2\E[m:us=2\E[4m:ue=2\E[m:\
	:md=2\E[1m:mr=2\E[7m:mb=2\E[5m:me=2\E[m:is=\E[1;24r\E[24;1H:\
	:rs=\E>\E[?3l\E[?4l\E[?5l\E[?7h\E[?8h:ks=\E[?1h\E=:ke=\E[?1l\E>:\
	:ku=\EOA:kd=\EOB:kr=\EOC:kl=\EOD:kb=^H:\

	:mi:al=\E[L:dc=\E[P:dl=\E[M:ei=\E[4l:im=\E[4h:'
export TERMCAP


Multibyte locale support
========================

Support for multibyte locales has been added to vi. It requires a number of
functions that, while specified in XPG6, are not present on all systems that
provide basic multibyte support. In particular, vi needs wcwidth() to
determine the visual width of a character, and mbrtowc() to detect when a
byte sequence that is entered at the terminal has been completed.

The multibyte code is known to work on the following systems:

Linux           glibc 2.2.2 and later
Sun Solaris     9 and later
HP HP-UX        B.11.11 and later
FreeBSD         5.3
NetBSD          2.0

It has been tested on xterm patch #192, rxvt-unicode 4.2, mlterm 2.9.1,
xiterm 0.5, and gnome-terminal 2.10.0.

Successful operation is known for the following encodings: UTF-8, EUC-JP,
EUC-KR, Big5, Big5-HKSCS, GB 2312, GBK. vi does not support locking-shift
encodings like those that use ISO 2022 escape sequences. It also requires
that the first byte of any multibyte character has the highest bit set.
This excludes 7-bit encodings like UTF-7, and encodings whose sequences
start with ASCII characters like TCVN 5712.

To use UTF-8 locales in ex mode, the terminal should be put in 'stty iutf8'
mode on Linux if it does not perform this automatically. Otherwise, typing
the erase key once after entering a multibyte character will result in an
incomplete byte sequence.
